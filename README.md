# üí´ About Me:
‚≠ï Hello! My name is <b> Faizan Alam </b> and I am currently pursuing my degree in <b>Bachelor in Computer Science</b> with a focus on <b> web development and UX design </b>. Although I am still a student, I have a strong foundation in MERN development and UX design and I am eager to apply my skills to real-world projects.

‚≠ï As a MERN developer, I have experience working with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. I am also proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can use these skills to create responsive and user-friendly web applications.

‚≠ï In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong understanding of UX design principles and practices. I am skilled in user research, wireframing, prototyping, and user testing, and I am passionate about creating interfaces that are intuitive, visually appealing, and accessible to all users.

‚≠ï As a student, I have developed excellent time management and organizational skills, and I am able to balance my academic responsibilities with my passion for web development and UX design. I am also a great team player and enjoy collaborating with others to create the best possible product.

‚≠ï If you are looking for a dedicated and enthusiastic MERN developer and UX designer with a strong foundation in web development and design, then I would love to hear from you.
